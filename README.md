# NO SQL Engine for big data applications

The definition of big data is data that contains greater variety, arriving in increasing volumes and with more velocity. This is also known as the three Vs.

Put simply, big data is larger, more complex data sets, especially from new data sources. These data sets are so voluminous that traditional data processing software just can’t manage them. But these massive volumes of data can be used to address business problems you wouldn’t have been able to tackle before.

## Implementation

Algorithms and data structures were implemente from scretch in programing language Golang with best possible performance in mind. Also all engine layers could be configured from a single config.yaml file located in root of this repo.

For testing purposes we created API and hosted it on: https://nasp.mattmarketing.rs/ so you can try it for your self.
